/**
 * VS CODE FREEZE GUARD EXTENSION - Main Entry Point
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This file serves as the entry point for the VS Code FreezeGuard extension.
 * It handles extension lifecycle events (activation/deactivation) and registers
 * the performance monitoring commands that parallel the IntelliJ plugin functionality.
 * 
 * CROSS-PLATFORM MONITORING ARCHITECTURE:
 * This VS Code extension mirrors the IntelliJ plugin structure to provide
 * consistent performance monitoring across IDEs:
 * 
 * IntelliJ Plugin ↔ VS Code Extension
 * =====================================
 * EDT Monitoring  ↔ Main Thread Monitoring
 * AnAction        ↔ vscode.commands.registerCommand  
 * BadBlockingAction ↔ badBlockingAction
 * BackgroundFixAction ↔ backgroundFixAction
 * FreezeGuardAction ↔ freezeGuardAction
 * HTTP Telemetry  ↔ HTTP Telemetry (same collector service)
 * 
 * VS CODE EXTENSION LIFECYCLE:
 * 1. Installation: User installs extension from marketplace or manually
 * 2. Activation: VS Code calls activate() when extension is needed
 * 3. Command Registration: Extension registers commands in Command Palette
 * 4. Monitor Startup: Main thread monitoring begins automatically
 * 5. User Interaction: User runs commands via Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
 * 6. Deactivation: VS Code calls deactivate() when shutting down
 * 7. Cleanup: Monitor stops, resources are cleaned up
 * 
 * ACTIVATION TRIGGERS:
 * This extension activates when VS Code starts (see package.json activationEvents).
 * Unlike IntelliJ which activates per-project, VS Code extensions are typically
 * global to the entire editor instance.
 * 
 * COMMAND REGISTRATION:
 * Commands are registered with VS Code's command system and appear in:
 * - Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P → type "Freeze Guard")
 * - Can be assigned to keyboard shortcuts
 * - Can be triggered programmatically by other extensions
 * 
 * THREADING DIFFERENCES VS INTELLIJ:
 * - IntelliJ: EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) for UI, background threads for work
 * - VS Code: Main thread for UI/extension code, web workers for heavy computation
 * - Both: Monitor main/EDT thread for performance issues
 * 
 * EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
 * This demonstrates VS Code extension development patterns:
 * - Proper activation/deactivation lifecycle
 * - Command registration and management
 * - Resource cleanup and subscription management
 * - Cross-platform consistency with other IDE implementations

/**
 * ACTIVATE - Extension Initialization and Command Registration
 * 
 * This function is called by VS Code when the extension needs to be activated.
 * It sets up the monitoring system and registers all performance testing commands.
 * 
 * ACTIVATION SEQUENCE:
 * 1. Log activation status for debugging
 * 2. Start main thread monitoring (equivalent to EDT monitoring in IntelliJ)
 * 3. Register all command handlers with VS Code's command system
 * 4. Add command disposables to extension context for proper cleanup
 * 5. Log successful setup confirmation
 * 
 * COMMAND REGISTRATION DETAILS:
 * Each command maps a string identifier to a function:
 * - 'freezeguard.measure' → freezeGuardAction (baseline performance measurement)
 * - 'freezeguard.badBlocking' → badBlockingAction (intentional main thread blocking)
 * - 'freezeguard.backgroundFix' → backgroundFixAction (proper async work)
 * 
 * SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT:
 * Adding commands to context.subscriptions ensures VS Code will:
 * - Properly dispose of command registrations when extension deactivates
 * - Prevent memory leaks from dangling command handlers
 * - Clean up resources automatically during shutdown
 * 
 * MONITORING STARTUP:
 * monitor.start() begins main thread stall detection:
 * - Creates setInterval that fires every 50ms
 * - Measures timing delays to detect main thread blocking
 * - Accumulates stall statistics for telemetry
 * - Runs continuously until extension deactivates
 * 
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * Currently no explicit error handling because:
 * - Command registration rarely fails in normal VS Code usage
 * - Monitor startup is designed to be robust
 * - VS Code handles extension errors gracefully without crashing editor
 * - Console logging provides debugging information if issues occur
 * 
 * @param context VS Code extension context providing lifecycle management and storage

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // ACTIVATION LOGGING: Confirm extension is starting up
  console.log('VSCode FreezeGuard extension activated');
  
  // START MONITORING: Begin main thread stall detection
  // This parallels the EDT monitoring in the IntelliJ plugin
  monitor.start();

  // COMMAND REGISTRATION: Register performance testing commands
  // These appear in Command Palette as "Freeze Guard: ..." entries
  const measureCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand('freezeguard.measure', freezeGuardAction);
  const badBlockingCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand('freezeguard.badBlocking', badBlockingAction);
  const backgroundFixCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand('freezeguard.backgroundFix', backgroundFixAction);

  // SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT: Add commands to context for automatic cleanup
  // This ensures proper resource disposal when extension deactivates
  context.subscriptions.push(measureCommand);
  context.subscriptions.push(badBlockingCommand);

/**
 * DEACTIVATE - Extension Cleanup and Resource Disposal
 * 
 * This function is called by VS Code when the extension is being shut down.
 * It performs cleanup to prevent resource leaks and ensure graceful shutdown.
 * 
 * DEACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
 * - VS Code is closing
 * - Extension is being disabled by user
 * - Extension is being updated/reinstalled
 * - VS Code is reloading extensions
 * 
 * CLEANUP SEQUENCE:
 * 1. Log deactivation status for debugging
 * 2. Stop main thread monitor (clears setInterval, prevents continued execution)
 * 3. VS Code automatically disposes command registrations (via context.subscriptions)
 * 
 * RESOURCE CLEANUP:
 * - monitor.stop() clears the setInterval timer to prevent background execution
 * - Command disposables are automatically handled by VS Code via context.subscriptions  
 * - No explicit memory cleanup needed (JavaScript garbage collection handles objects)
 * 
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * VS Code ensures deactivate() is called on the main thread, so no synchronization
 * is needed when stopping the monitor or cleaning up resources.
 * 
 * COMPARISON WITH INTELLIJ:
 * - IntelliJ: Daemon threads auto-cleanup on JVM shutdown
 * - VS Code: Must explicitly clear JavaScript timers to prevent continued execution
 * - Both: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks and ensures clean shutdown
